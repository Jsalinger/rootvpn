Changelog

*6/6/2012:
1. Major improvements, not the to beauty of the
code, but in terms of functionality.
2. Can now connect to VPN when on WiFi network.
3. DNS servers are properly setup and reset 
before VPN connection and reset after connection 
is no longer being used.

*6/2/2012:
1. Changed behavior of disconnect from VPN method - 
should never fail, only return true, because if 
the process is no longer running, VPN died on its
own already, and should be allowed to be restarted.
